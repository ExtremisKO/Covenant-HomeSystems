Changelog:

0.1.1 (NOT SAVE COMPATIBLE)
Added ship: Maugen pattern armoured cruiser.
Completely overhauled built-in weapons and changed them into S/M/L missiles and L energy.

Bug fixes (that I remember):
- Fixed frigate wings bought from markets as ships with no upkeep costs.
- Sinaris stats.
- Covenant weapon appearances at markets (hopefully).
- Removed Nexerelin and AOTD dependency.


0.1.0
Now with less lag with updated bounds.
Updated with the help of @CombustibleLemon . Wings should stop causing crashes.
