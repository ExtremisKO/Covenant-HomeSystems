Covenant HomeSystems is a mod for the game Starsector. It's compatible with Nexerelin, but currently incompatible with the UNSC mod by AppleMarineXX and its expansion by StargazerRJL.

FEATURES:
Adds a high tech and late-game faction to the game to the east of the core worlds comprising 5 planets (sizes 9, 8, 7, 6, 6). Ships all have high flux cap and dissipation, but Covenant weapon flux usage is correspondingly high, take care when using these weapons on other craft, but have low(ish) armour and hull. EVERYONE HATES THE COVENANT.
May be overnerfed due to high individual ship power (I think) and very high cost, default ships tend to accumulate flux quickly-ish even when firing and not taking damage.

SHIPS ADDED:
- Zanar pattern
- Makar pattern
- Ester pattern*
- Ceudar pattern
- Sinaris pattern*
- Ket pattern*
- Onura pattern
- Varric pattern
- ... and 3 absolute behemoths ||(Vindraon pattern, Kerel pattern*, Yerus pattern)||
WEAPONS ADDED:
- Gon pulse laser (small pd)*
- Melusean (medium energy)*
- Cheru pattern Tyrant (large energy)
- Figher/LPC weapons (less powerful Melusean, Fuel Rod cannon)
Built-in weapons* (beams and missiles) for various vessels, the most powerful part of the ships.
LPCs:
- Space Banshee
- Seraph
- Frigates (I hope they work)?!
HULLMODs:
- Shield with code taken from Star Wars mod (I hope that's ok)
- Hullmods from original UNSC mod.
Assets taken from UNSC mod by AppleMarineXX and expansion by StargazerRJL are marked by an asterix ( * ).
Sprites taken from Halo wiki and free-to-access artworks on Artstation by Jared Harris (these look amazing).

Currently only incompatible with the UNSC mod by AppleMarineXX and its expansion by StargazerRJL.
